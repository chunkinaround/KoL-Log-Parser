    "# KOLMafia RunLog Generator (v1.0)\n",
    "_A Styling Project by Aaron M. (AKA Captain Scotch, #437479)_\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey all! This is a wrapper meant to isolate and analyze Ascension logs via Python, formatting everything into a clean Excel wrapper. Originally, this was simply an overlay of [CKB's run log parser in ASH](https://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?22963-RunLogSummary), which is fantastic, but as I'm more of a Python dev this quickly enlarged into a broader project that turned into a personal goal to build a Python log parser. That's this! Contact me in-game or in the Ascension Speed Society discord for any questions."
